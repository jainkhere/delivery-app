# Getting Started

Clone the project:

```
> git@github.com:jainkhere/delivery-app.git
> cd delivery-app
```

Then make sure that you are on branch 'main':

```
> npm install
> npm start
```

Then go to (http://localhost:3000/)

This app is PWA, which means the app is responsive and easier to use on any screen size.
Having said that, the app is best viewed in mobile phone screen. You can easlity switch to smaller dimension screens using browser's inspect element tool.

We tried to deploy our react app on github pages, were getting error due to some url redirect issues. The app is still deployed here - (https://jainkhere.github.io/delivery-app/) but nothing is being rendered except header.
